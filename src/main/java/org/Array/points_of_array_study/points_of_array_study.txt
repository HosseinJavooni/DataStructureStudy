in Java core there are two dynamic array implementations (It is not an Array really, but we can see it in that manner)
1. Vector
2. ArrayList
Vector vs ArrayList:
    similarities:
        - both are in "java.util" package.
    differences:
        - When Vector wants to become larger it's grows 100% but in ArrayList 50%
        - Vector methods are synchronized but ArrayList method are not! so in multi thread situation it is not the good choice.
